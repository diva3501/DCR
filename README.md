# FedEX SMART Hackathon
 
# Dynamic Route Optimization and Emission Reduction

## Project Overview

**Dynamic Route Optimization and Emission Reduction** is a Python-based platform designed to optimize vehicle routes for Realtime Uses in Day to Day and Leveraging Business Field for logistics and transportation companies by advanced real-time traffic, weather, and vehicle-specific data. The system integrates APIs such as TomTom, Google Maps, AQICN, and OSRM to calculate efficient routes, estimate CO₂ emissions, and promote environmental sustainability.

The platform adapts to changing conditions, prioritizing timely deliveries while ensuring a user-friendly and eco-conscious experience. The solution is designed to reduce carbon footprints by providing environmentally friendly travel alternatives without compromising on speed and efficiency. The system also includes a model and pipeline for optimized route recommendations, along with an interactive UI/UX to enhance user experience.

## Key Features

- **Smart Route Selection with Multiple Options**: The platform provides multiple route options, allowing users to choose based on speed, distance, and emissions.
  
- **Emission Optimization for Eco-friendly Travel**: Calculates CO₂ emissions for each route and suggests greener alternatives where possible.

- **Real-time Traffic and Weather Integration**: Uses APIs to incorporate real-time data on traffic and weather conditions to provide dynamic routing and accurate estimations.

- **Easy-to-Use, Interactive Map Interface**: Provides a simple and interactive map to visualize routes, emissions, and travel alternatives.

- **Real-time & Scalable Backend Processing**: A robust backend for real-time updates and scalability.

- **Detailed Results Display**: The platform displays detailed information about routes, emissions, and estimated travel times.

- **Interactive & Modern UI/UX Design**: A user-friendly interface that is simple to navigate and enhances user experience.

- **Sustainability & Environmental Awareness**: Prioritizes sustainability by providing users with the option to make eco-conscious travel decisions.

- **Notifications & Alerts**: Sends notifications and alerts to users about changes in traffic, weather, or routes.

- **User Customization**: Allows users to customize preferences such as vehicle type, route types (fastest, shortest, eco-friendly), and more.
  
- **Model and Pipeline for Optimization**: Integrated model and pipeline for continuous optimization of routes and emissions, adapting to real-time data.

## Technology Stack

### Frontend:
- **HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 5**: Used for designing the user interface and ensuring responsiveness across different devices.
- **Leaflet.js**: A lightweight JavaScript library for creating interactive maps.

### Backend:
- **Python**: Flask or Django framework for creating the backend server and handling API integrations.
- **OpenRouteService API** (or **Google Maps API**): For route optimization and driving directions.
- **Weather API** (OpenWeather, AccuWeather): For real-time weather data to adjust routes based on weather conditions.
- **Emission Calculation**: Predefined formulas used to calculate vehicle emissions based on routes.

### Real-Time Functionality:
- **WebSockets**: Used for real-time updates, including route changes, traffic, weather, and emission updates.

### Database:
- **MySQL or PostgreSQL**: Relational databases for saving user preferences, past routes, and system configurations.

### Authentication (if required in later phases):
- **JWT-based Authentication**: Secure user authentication to allow saving preferences or viewing history.
